'Join Game' tab on the homepage, or link them the website URL once you're in the game screen. <br/><br/>

## Playing the Game
There are 2 roles: Guesser and Psychic. Each turn, one player will be the Psychic and all other players will be Guessers. 
Each round is played with a category that you can choose yourself (Examples: Lightest - Heaviest | Worst Movie - Best Movie | Worst Song - Best Song). You can
keep track of this category yourself through Discord, or any other medium for communicating with your friends.

The Psychic rolls a random number between 1-20. The Psychic then gives a hint corresponding to where the number falls within the category.
The Guessers will try to guess what number the Psychic rolled based on the hint.
For example, let's say the category is Worst Movie - Best Movie and I roll a 20. A 20 is the highest number so I have to say the best movie I can think of, "The Dark Knight". 
The Guessers have to guess where I would rank "The Dark Knight". <br/> <br/>

- If a Guesser was the closest to the actual number, they gain a point. <br/>
- If 2 Guessers were equidistant to the actual number, they both gain a point. <br/>
- If a Guesser hit the actual number exactly, both the Guesser and Psychic gain a point.

After all players have guessed and points are assigned, the Psychic can press the 'Next Turn' button to pass the Psychic role to the next player and begin the next turn.
Once each player has played Psychic, you can choose a new category or play another round on the same category.
